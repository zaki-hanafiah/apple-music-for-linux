## Set your region

The app should auto-detect your current location, if it fails to set the correct region for you, use the following commands to set it manually:

```
mkdir -p ~/snap/apple-music-for-linux/common
echo "GB" > ~/snap/apple-music-for-linux/common/locale
```

(Replace "GB" above with the respective [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code for your country)
